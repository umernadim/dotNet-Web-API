# 🌐 .NET Web API + React CRUD Application

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack practice application** built using **ASP.NET Core Web API** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.
The main goal of the project was to understand how to create RESTful APIs, perform CRUD operations, test them using Postman, and finally consume those APIs inside a React application.

The backend handles all data operations, while the frontend provides a simple user interface to interact with the API.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

### Backend

* ASP.NET Core Web API
* C#
* Entity Framework Core
* SQL Server
* RESTful API principles

### Frontend

* React (JavaScript)
* Axios / Fetch API for HTTP requests
* Basic Bootstrap for UI

### Tools

* Postman (for API testing)
* Visual Studio
* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

## ⚙️ Features

* Create new records via API (POST)
* View existing records (GET)
* Update records (PUT)
* Delete records (DELETE)
* API tested using Postman before frontend integration
* React UI to perform CRUD operations visually
* Form-based input and dynamic data rendering
  
## 🔄 Development Flow

1. Created the ASP.NET Core Web API project.
2. Implemented **Create** and **View** operations first to understand routing and controllers.
3. Extended the API to support full **CRUD** functionality.
4. Tested all endpoints using **Postman**.
5. Built a React frontend to consume the API and perform operations from the UI.

## 📌 Purpose of This Project

This project was built as a **learning and practice exercise** to:

* Understand how frontend and backend communicate
* Practice RESTful API development
* Learn API testing using Postman
* Integrate React with .NET Web API

## 🧱 Future Improvements

* Add authentication and authorization (JWT)
* Improve UI/UX design
* Add validation and error handling
* Deploy backend and frontend
